This is a utility which converts HyperLynx files to CSXCAD for electromagnetic simulation.

Dependencies: requires libhpdf, libpng, zlib.
Tested on Linux ubuntu, MacOSX and Windows/MingW.

On Linux ubuntu, with libhpdf installed in /usr/lib:
 ./configure

On MacOSX, with libhpdf installed in /opt/local using MacPorts:
  CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib ./configure

On Windows with MingW, compiling a static binary:
  CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS="-static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure

Default is building the hyp2mat executable only.
If you wish to install not only the executable, but also the hyp2mat library, includes and package information, add the "--enable-library" flag, e.g. "configure --enable-library"

Default is building the static libhyp2mat.a library only.
If you wish to build not only the static library, but also the shared libhyp2mat.so library, add the "--enable-shared" flag, e.g. "configure --enable-library --enable-shared"

Note to self: Check source using 'CXXFLAGS="-g -Wall -pedantic" ./configure' and 'cppcheck -v --enable=all --max-configs=24 .' .
