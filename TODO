Fix polygons. 
At the moment polygons are drawn with zero line width. This is wrong.

From the Hyperlynx manual:
HyperLynx polygons ("POLYGON")
- have a contour, consisting of straight lines ("LINE") and circular arcs ("CURVE")
- the contour has a width ("W")
- may have several cut-outs or holes ("POLYVOID"). The contour of the holes is a sequence of straight lines and circular arcs.

To correctly import a Hyperlynx polygon in CSXCAD, one has to go through the following steps:
- create polygon from line and arc segments
- create holes from line and arc segments
- subtract holes from polygon
- extend polygon by width w/2
- reduce self-intersecting polygon to set of non-intersecting polygons
- draw

Implement a CXDCAD primitive for Hyperlynx polygons using a computational geometry library, e.g.Â cgal.org ?
