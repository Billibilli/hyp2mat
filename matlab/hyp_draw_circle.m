% CSX = hyp_draw_arc(CSX, propName, prio, center, rad)
% Add a circular disc to CSX and assign to a property with name <propName>.
% The disc is parallel with the xy plane.
%
%  center:  circle center coordinates
%  rad  :   circle radius
%  prio :   primitive priority
%
%  Example:
%       CSX = AddMetal(CSX,'metal'); %create PEC with propName 'metal'
%       CSX = hyp_draw_circle(CSX,'metal',10,[0 0 0],50);
