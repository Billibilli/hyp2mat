This is a utility which converts HyperLynx files to CSXCAD for electromagnetic simulation.

Dependencies: requires libhpdf, libpng, zlib.
Tested on Linux ubuntu, MacOSX and Windows/MingW.

Default is building the hyp2mat executable only.
If you wish to install not only the executable, but also the hyp2mat library, includes and package information, add the "--enable-library" flag, e.g. "configure --enable-library"

Default is building the static libhyp2mat.a library only.
If you wish to build not only the static library, but also the shared libhyp2mat.so library, add the "--enable-shared" flag, e.g. "configure --enable-library --enable-shared"

On Linux ubuntu, with libhpdf installed in /usr/lib:
  ./configure
  make 
  make install

On MacOSX, with libhpdf installed in /opt/local using MacPorts:
  CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib ./configure
  make 
  make install

On Windows:

  Install MinGW (http://www.mingw.org)

  Compile zlib, libpng and libharu (libhpdf):

  zlib-1.2.7
  INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib BINARY_PATH=/usr/bin make -f win32/Makefile.gcc  install
  
  libpng-1.5.14
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  
  libharu-2.2.1
  Download libharu-2.2.1-png15.patch from http://sisyphus.ru/en/srpm/Sisyphus/libharu/patches/0
  Patch libharu: 
  patch -p0 < libharu-2.2.1-png15.patch
  ./configure
  make
  make install

  Compile hyp2mat as a static binary: 
  
  hyp2mat
  CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS="-static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure
  make
  make install
