This is a utility which converts HyperLynx files to CSXCAD for electromagnetic simulation.

Tested on Linux ubuntu, MacOSX and Windows/MingW.

Dependencies: requires gerbv, cairo.

Default is installing the hyp2mat executable only.
If you wish to install not only the executable, but also the hyp2mat library, includes and package information, add the "--enable-library" flag, e.g. "configure --enable-library"

Default is building the static libhyp2mat.a library only.
If you wish to build not only the static library, but also the shared libhyp2mat.so library, add the "--enable-shared" flag, e.g. "configure --enable-library --enable-shared"

The following packages are necessary for development: g++, libtool, make, bison, flex, gengetopt, help2man, groff, ps2pdf.

Patch gerbv-2.6.0 with the included gerbv-2.6.0.patch, build and install.

  tar xvf gerbv-2.6.0.tar.gz
  patch -p0 < ../src/hyp2mat/gerbv-2.6.0.patch
  cd gerbv-2.6.0/
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/openEMS/
